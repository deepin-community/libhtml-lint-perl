    [CHANGES THAT COULD BREAK YOUR CODE]
    Previously, html_ok() would not check the entire structure of a web
    page to check for <html>, <head>, <title> and <body> tags.  Now it
    will.  If you want to check fragments of HTML for validity but know
    that they are not valid HTML documents on their own, use the new
    html_fragment_ok().
